title: Two melting snowmen.

Separated by a great white expanse, they stand 
A he and a she, draped in flakes
Alone they stood, in an unrelenting blizzard
Forever unknown to each other, in a winter with no end.

Along came a nomad, armed with a blaze
Furious sparks spewed from his great light
The darkness abates and light took it's place 
And across the abyss, he saw her and was amazed. 

Warmed by his gaze she melted away 
Vestiges of her soul moved up his way
In her warmth his heart did open
Letting out little birds that fluttered away

Fluid was he, in her warm embrace
United were they, melting in grace
And there were no two snowmen when the nomad returned
But one soul floating away, that He had warmed.
