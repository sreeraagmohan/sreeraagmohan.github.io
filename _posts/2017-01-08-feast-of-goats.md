After reading 52 books in 2016, I thought I'd settle down for a much smaller number this year, mostly because I wanted to delve deeper into the literature I read, spend more time thinking, analyzing, losing myself in the thoughts of the author. The voracious reader in me would still not let go, as I find myself huddled in my room, blazing through book after book. A week into 2017 and I am already into my second read of the year, and boy, it has been a really memorable one.

I had always wanted to read Latin American fiction, with most of Gabriel García Márquez's work on my reading list for this year. However, before I step into Márquez's world of magical realism, I wanted to read another famed Latin American author - Mario Vargas Llosa. His 2000 book, *The Feast of the Goat*, is what I got my hands on. 

*The Feast of the Goat* is no easy novel to begin with. Llosa vividly portrays the harsh reality of tyranny through the story of the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, 'the Goat'. The novel, in two parallel threads, follows the last days of the *Benevolent Father*, and how his tyrannical rule deprived a fourteen-year old girl, Urania Cabral, of her childhood. A masterful blend of history and fiction, the novel is vivid in it's depiction of the Dominican Republic under Trujillo's regime, and often left me gasping for breath, shocked at times as I read Llosa's prose. 

What a start to 2017 has it been!
