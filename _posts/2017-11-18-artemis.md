I had read <em>The Martian</em> previously, and I started off this book with high expectations. Andy Weir's previous book told the story of a man on Mars and was filled to the brim with brilliant science, and I expected more of the same from <em>Artemis</em>. Turns out that this book gets there, but not quite. 

<em>Artemis</em> is set on the moon, at the first city built on it. Weir delves into more scientific detail than <em>The Martian</em>, and Weir lays out a detailed description on how life would be on the moon. Weir's research here is astounding and showcases the level of research that has gone into the book. 

Weir was never someone to claim that he is a prolific author, and that reflects here. <em>Artemis</em> features much of the flat prose with a more-than-necessary garnishing of profanity. But what really brings down the book is its recycled plot; the plot is only half as interesting as the setting of the novel, eventually leading to its downfall towards the climax of the book. 

Brownie points for the scientific insight, but well, <em>meh.</em>
