Romantically, love must surely reside in the gap between desire and fulfilment, in the lack, not the contentment. Love is the ache, the anticipation, the retreat, everything around it but the emotion itself. Which would explain why people get bored of each other, why divorce lawyers just seem to be getting richer and richer and why Ashley Madison does not seem to be a big deal anymore. For we humans have a constant craving to be excited. In this age of instant gratification, where when two people swipe right and you end up on a date, patience has lost its value. Gone are those days when sleepless nights were cherished, when each word that passed through her lips had monumental valie.

For love is not contentment - in it can never be content. Love is not fulfilment - it can never be fulfilled. Love is the ache, the incurable want, the never ending desire for someone - that dies when you do.
