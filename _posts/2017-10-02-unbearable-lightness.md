For those who are looking for an intricate plot with definitive character development, look away, as this book is not for you. <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em> oozes Milan Kundera's philosophy on life, and is a wonderful read, if you can keep pace with the author's fragmented train of thought. 

Leafing through this book, I found myself reaching out over and over for my highlighter. Kundera, armed with beautiful prose, often feels like a prophet, dishing out words of wisdom as the reader flips through the pages. I often felt that a critical analysis of the book, akin to one by Gurcharan Das on <em>The Mahabharata</em> would not be a bad idea. 

**Life.**

> <em>The world essentially rests on the moral perversity of the nonexistence of return. For in this world, everything is pardoned in advance, and therefore everything is cynically permitted.</em>


Kundera uses the example of Hitler and the nonexistence of a second Reign of Terror in France as ways to justify the protagonist's dilemma and his search for love with Tereza. For when it comes to questions of the heart, there is no way to test the outcome as there is no basis for comparison. Kundera states that we, as humans, live everything as it comes, and asks an important question : for what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself?

> <em>Einmal est keinmal, Franz thought to himself. What happens but once, goes the German adage, might as well not happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might not have lived it at all.</em>


**Love.**

Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two different passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).


Tomas, the protagonist of the story, has a serious problem with infidelity, and this is where Tomas' dilemma stems from. But soon, Tomas does realize that his infidelities will never result in his deliverance, as is revealed from the above quote. 

> <em>There are things that can be accomplished only by violence. Physical love is unthinkable without violence.</em>


An often misunderstood quote, Kundera here does not refer to violence as the malicious intent of one person to cause another harm. Rather, it is the emotional barriers to love that get broken down when we fall hopelessly in love with our counterpart. This is the reason love is so hard, it is the singular emotion that requires every other emotion to become present before we recognize for what it is, love.

> <em>Love is the longing for the half of ourselves that we have lost.</em>


**Fear.**

The character of Tereza is Kundera's gateway to the dichotomy of the body and the soul. Kundera pairs the body with lightness, and the soul with weight. Tomas's infidelities weigh heavy on Tereza's soul, so much that she is able to reconcile with the lightness. Tereza is weighed down by the events of her traumatic childhood and the issues that she thinks she has with her body. Soon after the death of their pet, Karenin, Tereza realizes that she is alone in the world, and she was nothing but a <em>'rumbling of the stomach.'</em>

> <em>Vertigo is something other than the fear of falling. It is the voice of emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves.</em>


A masterpiece of a book by Milan Kundera. One to definitely have in every avid reader's bookshelf.
