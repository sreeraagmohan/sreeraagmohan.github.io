In a teeming world of people, he was alone. As he walked past the poster that screamed, ‘a small family is a happy family’ and televisions that aired latently erotic advertisements for contraceptives in flashy electronic stores, he couldn’t but smirk. Are there so many of us in the world? 

 He scanned the panorama as he waited for the bus. A maddening rush of emotionless people. In a haste to a place they don’t know where, striving to achieve something they know not. A deafeningly silent, perpetually pulsating machine. What are you working for, human? Is money going to complete you? Is your status symbol going to make you whole again? 

Seven and half billion hearts, and none of them could match his rhythm. Fifteen billion eyes, yet none could hold his gaze. Yet, the world says there are too many people. 

For him, the world would always remain incomplete, would forever not have just enough people. For nobody came and held his hand, for nobody came and made his heart skip a beat. His world would forever have a void, a void that nobody else could fill. 

There was only one person who could complete him. 

And now he isn’t.
