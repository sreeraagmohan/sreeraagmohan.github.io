Like a moth, I was born in the rain that was her presence. A Kafkaesque metamorphosis, I was transformed into a living being in the cold, soothing rain that spread all over my nascent body. I gyrated to the rhythm of her legs, her anklet a timely metronome. As she looked towards me, I found myself photo taxiing towards her radiance, her light illuminating eveything around us. As her lips parted, I found myself fluttering my wings rapidly in a desperate attempt to defy gravity. 

God, what I wouldn't do to be there.

And I felt like I could do anything. I felt I could fly to close to her brilliance and take it all in. I felt I could spread my wings wide enough and make her light all mine. 

Like a fallen Icarus, I flew too close to her. My wings shriveled, my body burned. I rapidly descended, my wings a fiery mess. 

Yet, she shone brilliantly.

Fluttering on the ground and awaiting Anubis, I looked up to her. And in that moment, all I could remember was how we had gotten really close, and how every moment felt like I don't know her at all.
