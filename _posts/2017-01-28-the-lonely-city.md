*Loneliness is by no means a wholly worthless experience, but rather one that cuts right to the heart of what we value and what we need. Many marvellous things have emerged from the lonely city; things forged in loneliness, but also things that function to redeem it.*

I might not consider myself lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone, in solitude. It’s one of the few things that I am absolutely comfortable with - being comfortable with my own company, travelling alone in my own thoughts. Of course, this does not mean I’m a recluse - I have terrific friends, but I’m much more of an introvert than you might think. I need my own personal space. *A lot of personal space.* 

The book is two things - Olivia Laing’s experiences with loneliness, and a deep study on loneliness in art. She makes a study of people who are alone, who share her loneliness in what is one of the most populous cities on the planet, New York City. 

The Lonely City introduced me to a myriad of artists and photographers, some of them who I have never heard of. Andy Warhol, David Wojnarowicz, Valerie Solanas and Peter Hujar, among others. Laing explores loneliness and solitude in their work, including a brilliant analysis of Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks, on how the painting’s colours and subtle details (some of them which I have never noticed). In Hopper’s own words, *‘I was unconsciously painting the loneliness of a large city.’*

Fascinating and poignant, this book is for all the introverts, for the people who are perfectly comfortable in their own company, for those who value their solitude more than anything else.
