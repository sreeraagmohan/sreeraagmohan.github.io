Lying on this sand, I let my spirit disappear 
From this world, with just you in tow 
I would let it wander, without pain, forgotten
To the glorious shelters, somewhere in the sun
Far away from this world, far away from the pain
In this glorious sand, I write your name 
I hear the sea sing, I see the clouds spell
Wandering through the darkness to the light, 
We'd find a place, somewhere in the sun.
