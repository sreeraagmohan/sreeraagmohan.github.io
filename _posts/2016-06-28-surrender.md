Alone I stand, a broken man
With one last chance, but no
I won't turn my back to you
Take my hands, drag me down
Flay my self and fire at my skull
But I can't save what's left of you. 

Come back down, redeem yourself 
Let me find my way to you
Dissatisfied and empty in the inside
Give your life another try

If you find your victory, don't you cry
Don't you dance and parade the streets
In this land of make believe, dead and dry
Nothing lasts, it's all a dream and illusion
