> <em>You can’t kill desire. You can suppress it for a while, sometimes a long, long while, but one’s longings are eternal.</em>

As the events of a night unfold, Rabih Alameddine paints the picture of a brilliant mind in crisis. Tormented by his past, Jacob is visited by the alluring Satan, who urges Jacob to relive his past and every painful memory, cold, hurtful Death, who taunts him to give up on his life, and the fourteen holy helpers. Alameddine, after <em>An Unnecessary Woman</em>, amazes the reader with a profound, philosophical story that is witty, charming, and gloomy, all at the same time; a story of the war between memory and oblivion that we have to deal with in our everyday lives.

Jacob is a gay Arab with a traumatic past living in San Francisco at the height of AIDS. Left alone after the demise of his partner, Alameddine weaves through the poet's trauma, his naked yearning, sadness, despair and man's utter helplessness in crisis. His struggles with remembering his partner, his yearning to forget the past, all make him drown deeper into a muddled abyss, tormented by Satan's and Death's misdeeds. 

Alameddine amazes the reader yet again with brilliant prose, though I feel that this book might be more challenging to get through, in comparison to <em>An Unnecessary Woman.</em> The ramblings of a man who has lost his sanity is not something everyone can read, leave alone comprehend. But, as Satan says, <em>sanity is overrated.</em>
