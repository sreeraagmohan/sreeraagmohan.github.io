Step through the doors of darkness, beloved 
Extinguish the flame that consumes me
Devouring me with it's unholy heat 
Salvage what is left of my soul;
Take me on to a place far away, 
Away from where I know you, and you me 
Beyond the sands of time, across the seas of fate
To a land, alien, to a people, unprophesied
Just you and me, two anonymous fish
Free from the borders of the bowl.
