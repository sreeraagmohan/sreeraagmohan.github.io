It seems impossible to give this gem of a book a rating anything less than five stars. Hanya Yanagihara's _A Little Life_ is a far cry from the mundane, off the shelf books that you might pounce upon; it is a microcosm of the banality of human life.

Throughout this 720-page novel, you will come across moments of joy, happiness, elation, sorrow, despair, and sheer helplessness, as the author, through her beautiful, elegant prose, masterfully manages to make the reader relate to the characters of the book.

_A Little Life_ is one of those books that, upon completion, you wish to have been a bit more longer - or to have never ended. A book that will forever have a special place on my bookshelf.
