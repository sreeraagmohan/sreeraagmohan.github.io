> <em>THERE ARE FACES only an Indian can make. Like that baffled face when he is shocked by the most rational outcome of his own actions. He crosses the road like a cow, and he is startled by a truck. A vehicle on the road? How? He walks across the railway track, and he finds a train hurtling towards him. A train on a railway track? He is stunned. Cops who do not wear bulletproof vests break into a house to fight militants, and they are shot in their paunches. They stagger out looking bewildered. That baffled face, when boys fall off trains because they were dangling from the doorways, when illegal homes built on infirm soil collapse, when pilgrims are squashed in annual stampedes inside narrow temples.</em>


A drastic departure from Manu Joseph's previous books, <em>Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous</em> may not seem as fiction to many. With a few cosmetic changes, this short, quick read brings the journalist in Manu Joseph back to the fore. The author spares nobody with the pen that transforms into a shotgun in his hand, and deftly strikes down the inflated ego of many. Biased as it may seem, the book displays what the author thinks about a case that shook India's conscience, and continues to emit aftershocks even today. 

Maybe as a fellow Malayalee, I too must have felt the same about Miss Laila and the minor god that is Damodarbhai. It would be terribly unfair to the author to compare this book to his previous works, as <em>Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous</em> stands in a league of its own.
