The genesis of *An Era of Darkness* is the brilliant speech made by the author at the Oxford Union. At that time, the speech caught the imagination of many Indians, who were fed by English novelists who extolled the greatness of the British Empire, with a few of them even going as far ahead as to lay claim to some of India’s assets now as their ‘gifts’: the Indian railway network is a prime example. 

There have been many, excluding British nationalist authors of Niall Ferguson and the like, who have staunchly defended colonialism. The proponents of this argument have often claimed that British colonialism was less evil than those of the other colonial powers (Leopold’s Belgian Congo comes to mind). Often, these arguments are made considering how the commonwealth nations and the United States are faring today in the modern era. But what about a land which was by far the most prosperous nation in the world, the contributor of a quarter of the world’s GDP, the famed home of renowned artisans, acclaimed universities and a locus of science and technology, before the arrival of the East India Company in the 1600s?

It is this argument that Shashi Tharoor deftly brings down in his well-researched book, *An Era of Darkness*. Though a claimed nationalist, Tharoor’s arguments are not a biased rebuttal, they are backed by verifiable facts. With every chapter, the author hits home the argument that *everything* that the British did in India was never for the Indians, but for its own benefit. The racism, the economic exploitation, the policy of *divide et impera* were all meant to subjugate a once great people to their knees, to bow down to the might and ruthlessness of the Empire, to pay for the avarice of the East India Company. Raj apologists may claim that the idea of a unified India did not exist before the British Empire; but who is to say that left to its own, India could not have been a unified, pluralist democracy?

However ruthless and criminal the British Empire may be, it represented a democracy with free press and a conscious international image. This was not the case with many colonial powers or dictatorships around the world and Tharoor considers this to be key to Gandhism’s success. For a dictatorship that considered that exterminating Jews was the *right* thing, Gandhism and non-violence could have offered them no solutions. In Tharoor’s own words: ‘the ultimate tribute to the British Raj might lie in the quality of the Mahatma who opposed it.’

A grim, dark read for anybody, regardless of your interest in colonial history.
