Amidst this insanity,  
There seemed to be some clarity,  
Her presence, although a rarity,  
Was not removed from reality.

I am, devoid of brevity,  
For I have lost my sanity,  
Is my heart in captivity,  
Or am I drowning in perplexity? 

As I fall deeper, helplessly  
I cannot stop feeling you, infectiously  
Driving nails into my soul, mercilessly  
Have you not known? I have lost all sensitivity.
