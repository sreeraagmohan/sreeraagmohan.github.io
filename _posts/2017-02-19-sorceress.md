A beloved name lies inside my heart  
A fleeting glance, became the start  
A missing word, is what I awaited  
A wretched deception, was her creation  

Sorceress, she bound me in her spell  
Devoid of resistance, deeper I fell  
Failed to realize, all was a facade  
Boundless love, seethed in my veins.
