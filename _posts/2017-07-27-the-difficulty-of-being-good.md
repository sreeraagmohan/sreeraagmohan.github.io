The _Mahabharata_ has always been different from other epics. It does not have a grand climax, it's characters cannot be neatly compartmentalized, it conflicts with it's own self multiple times. This grandiose paradox is probably what makes the _Mahabharata_ sit a notch higher than other ancient mythologies, for the epic was never about a particular hero or great achievements. The _Mahabharata_ is a treatise on _dharma_, and Gurcharan Das, in his book titled _The Difficulty of Being Good_, tries to bring out parallels between episodes from the _Mahabharata_ and the contemporary world.

He largely succeeds in his endeavor, with his interpretations of the carefully selected passages from the Mahabharata both deeply insightful and elevating on a philosophical level. Das is true in echoing my sentiment when he states that _'it (the Mahabharata) poses more questions than it answers'_, and like _dharma_, in subtlety lie the answers.
