		<h1>Paranoia.</h1>
		<p><p>Amidst this insanity,<br />
There seemed to be some clarity,<br />
Her presence, although a rarity,<br />
Was not removed from reality.</p>

<p>I am, devoid of brevity,<br />
For I have lost my sanity,<br />
Is my heart in captivity,<br />
Or am I drowning in perplexity?</p>

<p>As I fall deeper, helplessly<br />
I cannot stop feeling you, infectiously<br />
Driving nails into my soul, mercilessly<br />
Have you not known? I have lost all sensitivity.</p>

		<h1>Sorceress.</h1>
		<p><p>A beloved name lies inside my heart<br />
A fleeting glance, became the start<br />
A missing word, is what I awaited<br />
A wretched deception, was her creation</p>

<p>Sorceress, she bound me in her spell<br />
Devoid of resistance, deeper I fell<br />
Failed to realize, all was a facade<br />
Boundless love, seethed in my veins.</p>

		<h1>On love, and the space between.</h1>
		<p><p>Romantically, love must surely reside in the gap between desire and fulfilment, in the lack, not the contentment. Love is the ache, the anticipation, the retreat, everything around it but the emotion itself. Which would explain why people get bored of each other, why divorce lawyers just seem to be getting richer and richer and why Ashley Madison does not seem to be a big deal anymore. For we humans have a constant craving to be excited. In this age of instant gratification, where when two people swipe right and you end up on a date, patience has lost its value. Gone are those days when sleepless nights were cherished, when each word that passed through her lips had monumental valie.</p>

<p>For love is not contentment - in it can never be content. Love is not fulfilment - it can never be fulfilled. Love is the ache, the incurable want, the never ending desire for someone - that dies when you do.</p>

		<h1>Reality, colours and dreams.</h1>
		<p><p>I once had a painter friend who usually painted scenes from life, mainly deserted rooms, abandoned houses and women. Gradually, his work became more abstract, and his paintings became just rebellious patches of colour. Dark blotches amidst deep shades of blue.</p>

<p>I asked about his progress from modern realism to abstraction. Reality has become so untolerable, he said, so bleak, that all I can paint now are the colours of my dreams.</p>

<p>The colours of my dreams.</p>

<p>How many people get a achance to paint the colours of their dreams? How many people get to dream beyond the visible spectrum and see colours that cannot be hexcoded, cannot be named, yet are just as truly stunning and beautiful like every other colour?</p>

<p>My dreams are not blue, they are not as vibrant a riot of colour that put a rangoli to shame. Monochromatic and binary, they exist on the very edge of the spectrum, absorbing as black, reflective as white.</p>

<p>In life, seldom are there shades of grey, and what is your life, if nothing but somebody else’s dream?</p>

		<h1>Time.</h1>
		<p><p>At any given second, billions of things are happening on Earth. A cloud is forming. An ant colony is carrying out their daily duties. A child is succumbing to hunger. A person is cheating on their spouse. An animal is dying at the hands (or jaws) of something higher up on the food chain. A fish is exploring the Titanic wreckage. A factory is packaging the Oreos you’re going to eat next week. Someone is crying. Someone is falling in love. Millions of people are sending and receiving text messages. All this and so much more is happening simultaneously, but we rarely think about it.</p>

<p>We only think about what matters to us, we only think about what we really care about. But, what if you have nothing or nobody to care for?</p>

<p>In a cannibalistic world, abundant with modern day slaves chasing each other like dogs, does anybody pause and listen to their heartbeat? Listen to what exactly they are feeling at that moment?</p>

<p>I wish I did. I wish I could go back and act on that impulse when I first had it. I wish I could go back and tell my boss that he is an asshole. I wish I could go back and tell that girl that I’ve fallen for her smile. I wish I could tell my ex that no, she’s the one who’s wrong.</p>

<p>If only time could slow down, down to a snail’s pace so that I can feel every microsecond of it. If only life wasn’t about making the quickest decisions in the best possible fashion. If only life gave me a second chance, to go back in time and relive everything that I want to experience now. Maybe then we’d all be more sentient beings.</p>

<p>Maybe then, things would’ve been better. Maybe then I wouldn’t have to recall her face from a faint memory. Maybe then, I wouldn’t have to keep hearing those painful words rhythmically repeating, like a hollow chant in my head as she broke up with me.</p>

<p>If only time could actually open it’s mouth and tell.</p>

		<h1>Metamorphosis.</h1>
		<p><p>Like a moth, I was born in the rain that was her presence. A Kafkaesque metamorphosis, I was transformed into a living being in the cold, soothing rain that spread all over my nascent body. I gyrated to the rhythm of her legs, her anklet a timely metronome. As she looked towards me, I found myself photo taxiing towards her radiance, her light illuminating eveything around us. As her lips parted, I found myself fluttering my wings rapidly in a desperate attempt to defy gravity.</p>

<p>God, what I wouldn’t do to be there.</p>

<p>And I felt like I could do anything. I felt I could fly to close to her brilliance and take it all in. I felt I could spread my wings wide enough and make her light all mine.</p>

<p>Like a fallen Icarus, I flew too close to her. My wings shriveled, my body burned. I rapidly descended, my wings a fiery mess.</p>

<p>Yet, she shone brilliantly.</p>

<p>Fluttering on the ground and awaiting Anubis, I looked up to her. And in that moment, all I could remember was how we had gotten really close, and how every moment felt like I don’t know her at all.</p>

		<h1>Two melting snowmen.</h1>
		<p><p>Separated by a great white expanse, they stand<br />
A he and a she, draped in flakes<br />
Alone they stood, in an unrelenting blizzard<br />
Forever unknown to each other, in a winter with no end.</p>

<p>Along came a nomad, armed with a blaze<br />
Furious sparks spewed from his great light<br />
The darkness abates and light took it’s place<br />
And across the abyss, he saw her and was amazed.</p>

<p>Warmed by his gaze she melted away<br />
Vestiges of her soul moved up his way<br />
In her warmth his heart did open<br />
Letting out little birds that fluttered away</p>

<p>Fluid was he, in her warm embrace<br />
United were they, melting in grace<br />
And there were no two snowmen when the nomad returned<br />
But one soul floating away, that He had warmed.</p>

		<h1>Separation.</h1>
		<p><p>They said it made the world smaller. They said it made the world come together and connect better.</p>

<p>He never felt the same.</p>

<p>With each text he sent, a monotonic increase, each moment he waited, an exponential wait in the aeon. He never felt closer to her, he never felt more connected to her.</p>

<p>As her smile pleasantly lights up tiny diodes behind his screen, he is amazed. It’s brilliant how these circuits can light up my world, he thinks to himself.</p>

<p>If only he could feel the emotion in those streams of bytes, travelling below the sea and above the ground. If only those binary digits dancing around his screen could morph into Xs and Os. If only the pixels of her hair had the smell of those luscious strands embedded in them.</p>

<p>Maybe then, his world would become a smaller place.</p>

		<h1>Incomplete.</h1>
		<p><p>In a teeming world of people, he was alone. As he walked past the poster that screamed, ‘a small family is a happy family’ and televisions that aired latently erotic advertisements for contraceptives in flashy electronic stores, he couldn’t but smirk. Are there so many of us in the world?</p>

<p>He scanned the panorama as he waited for the bus. A maddening rush of emotionless people. In a haste to a place they don’t know where, striving to achieve something they know not. A deafeningly silent, perpetually pulsating machine. What are you working for, human? Is money going to complete you? Is your status symbol going to make you whole again?</p>

<p>Seven and half billion hearts, and none of them could match his rhythm. Fifteen billion eyes, yet none could hold his gaze. Yet, the world says there are too many people.</p>

<p>For him, the world would always remain incomplete, would forever not have just enough people. For nobody came and held his hand, for nobody came and made his heart skip a beat. His world would forever have a void, a void that nobody else could fill.</p>

<p>There was only one person who could complete him.</p>

<p>And now he isn’t.</p>

From this world, with just you in tow <br />
I would let it wander, without pain, forgotten<br />
To the glorious shelters, somewhere in the sun<br />
Far away from this world, far away from the pain<br />
In this glorious sand, I write your name<br />
I hear the sea sing, I see the clouds spell<br />
Wandering through the darkness to the light,<br />
We’d find a place, somewhere in the sun.</p>
