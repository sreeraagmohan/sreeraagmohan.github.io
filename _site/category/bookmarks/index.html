		<h1>The Angel of History</h1>
		<p><blockquote>
  <p><em>You can’t kill desire. You can suppress it for a while, sometimes a long, long while, but one’s longings are eternal.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the events of a night unfold, Rabih Alameddine paints the picture of a brilliant mind in crisis. Tormented by his past, Jacob is visited by the alluring Satan, who urges Jacob to relive his past and every painful memory, cold, hurtful Death, who taunts him to give up on his life, and the fourteen holy helpers. Alameddine, after <em>An Unnecessary Woman</em>, amazes the reader with a profound, philosophical story that is witty, charming, and gloomy, all at the same time; a story of the war between memory and oblivion that we have to deal with in our everyday lives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em> How many rains must fall before the stains are washed clean once more? </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jacob is a gay Arab with a traumatic past living in San Francisco at the height of AIDS. Left alone after the demise of his partner, Alameddine weaves through the poet’s trauma, his naked yearning, sadness, despair and man’s utter helplessness in crisis. His struggles with remembering his partner, his yearning to forget the past, all make him drown deeper into a muddled abyss, tormented by Satan’s and Death’s misdeeds.</p>

<p>Alameddine amazes the reader yet again with brilliant prose, though I feel that this book might be more challenging to get through, in comparison to <em>An Unnecessary Woman.</em> The ramblings of a man who has lost his sanity is not something everyone can read, leave alone comprehend. But, as Satan says, <em>sanity is overrated.</em></p>

		<h1>Artemis</h1>
		<p><p>I had read <em>The Martian</em> previously, and I started off this book with high expectations. Andy Weir’s previous book told the story of a man on Mars and was filled to the brim with brilliant science, and I expected more of the same from <em>Artemis</em>. Turns out that this book gets there, but not quite.</p>

<p><em>Artemis</em> is set on the moon, at the first city built on it. Weir delves into more scientific detail than <em>The Martian</em>, and Weir lays out a detailed description on how life would be on the moon. Weir’s research here is astounding and showcases the level of research that has gone into the book.</p>

<p>Weir was never someone to claim that he is a prolific author, and that reflects here. <em>Artemis</em> features much of the flat prose with a more-than-necessary garnishing of profanity. But what really brings down the book is its recycled plot; the plot is only half as interesting as the setting of the novel, eventually leading to its downfall towards the climax of the book.</p>

<p>Brownie points for the scientific insight, but well, <em>meh.</em></p>

		<h1>Miss Laila - Armed and Dangerous</h1>
		<p><blockquote>
  <p><em>THERE ARE FACES only an Indian can make. Like that baffled face when he is shocked by the most rational outcome of his own actions. He crosses the road like a cow, and he is startled by a truck. A vehicle on the road? How? He walks across the railway track, and he finds a train hurtling towards him. A train on a railway track? He is stunned. Cops who do not wear bulletproof vests break into a house to fight militants, and they are shot in their paunches. They stagger out looking bewildered. That baffled face, when boys fall off trains because they were dangling from the doorways, when illegal homes built on infirm soil collapse, when pilgrims are squashed in annual stampedes inside narrow temples.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A drastic departure from Manu Joseph’s previous books, <em>Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous</em> may not seem as fiction to many. With a few cosmetic changes, this short, quick read brings the journalist in Manu Joseph back to the fore. The author spares nobody with the pen that transforms into a shotgun in his hand, and deftly strikes down the inflated ego of many. Biased as it may seem, the book displays what the author thinks about a case that shook India’s conscience, and continues to emit aftershocks even today.</p>

<p>Maybe as a fellow Malayalee, I too must have felt the same about Miss Laila and the minor god that is Damodarbhai. It would be terribly unfair to the author to compare this book to his previous works, as <em>Miss Laila, Armed and Dangerous</em> stands in a league of its own.</p>

		<h1>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</h1>
		<p><p>For those who are looking for an intricate plot with definitive character development, look away, as this book is not for you. <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em> oozes Milan Kundera’s philosophy on life, and is a wonderful read, if you can keep pace with the author’s fragmented train of thought.</p>

<p>Leafing through this book, I found myself reaching out over and over for my highlighter. Kundera, armed with beautiful prose, often feels like a prophet, dishing out words of wisdom as the reader flips through the pages. I often felt that a critical analysis of the book, akin to one by Gurcharan Das on <em>The Mahabharata</em> would not be a bad idea.</p>

<p><strong>Life.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The world essentially rests on the moral perversity of the nonexistence of return. For in this world, everything is pardoned in advance, and therefore everything is cynically permitted.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kundera uses the example of Hitler and the nonexistence of a second Reign of Terror in France as ways to justify the protagonist’s dilemma and his search for love with Tereza. For when it comes to questions of the heart, there is no way to test the outcome as there is no basis for comparison. Kundera states that we, as humans, live everything as it comes, and asks an important question : for what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Einmal est keinmal, Franz thought to himself. What happens but once, goes the German adage, might as well not happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might not have lived it at all.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Love.</strong></p>

<p>Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two different passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).</p>

<p>Tomas, the protagonist of the story, has a serious problem with infidelity, and this is where Tomas’ dilemma stems from. But soon, Tomas does realize that his infidelities will never result in his deliverance, as is revealed from the above quote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>There are things that can be accomplished only by violence. Physical love is unthinkable without violence.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An often misunderstood quote, Kundera here does not refer to violence as the malicious intent of one person to cause another harm. Rather, it is the emotional barriers to love that get broken down when we fall hopelessly in love with our counterpart. This is the reason love is so hard, it is the singular emotion that requires every other emotion to become present before we recognize for what it is, love.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Love is the longing for the half of ourselves that we have lost.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fear.</strong></p>

<p>The character of Tereza is Kundera’s gateway to the dichotomy of the body and the soul. Kundera pairs the body with lightness, and the soul with weight. Tomas’s infidelities weigh heavy on Tereza’s soul, so much that she is able to reconcile with the lightness. Tereza is weighed down by the events of her traumatic childhood and the issues that she thinks she has with her body. Soon after the death of their pet, Karenin, Tereza realizes that she is alone in the world, and she was nothing but a <em>‘rumbling of the stomach.’</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Vertigo is something other than the fear of falling. It is the voice of emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A masterpiece of a book by Milan Kundera. One to definitely have in every avid reader’s bookshelf.</p>

		<h1>The Difficulty of Being Good</h1>
		<p><p>The <em>Mahabharata</em> has always been different from other epics. It does not have a grand climax, it’s characters cannot be neatly compartmentalized, it conflicts with it’s own self multiple times. This grandiose paradox is probably what makes the <em>Mahabharata</em> sit a notch higher than other ancient mythologies, for the epic was never about a particular hero or great achievements. The <em>Mahabharata</em> is a treatise on <em>dharma</em>, and Gurcharan Das, in his book titled <em>The Difficulty of Being Good</em>, tries to bring out parallels between episodes from the <em>Mahabharata</em> and the contemporary world.</p>

<p>He largely succeeds in his endeavor, with his interpretations of the carefully selected passages from the Mahabharata both deeply insightful and elevating on a philosophical level. Das is true in echoing my sentiment when he states that <em>‘it (the Mahabharata) poses more questions than it answers’</em>, and like <em>dharma</em>, in subtlety lie the answers.</p>

		<h1>A Little Life</h1>
		<p><p>It seems impossible to give this gem of a book a rating anything less than five stars. Hanya Yanagihara’s <em>A Little Life</em> is a far cry from the mundane, off the shelf books that you might pounce upon; it is a microcosm of the banality of human life.</p>

<p>Throughout this 720-page novel, you will come across moments of joy, happiness, elation, sorrow, despair, and sheer helplessness, as the author, through her beautiful, elegant prose, masterfully manages to make the reader relate to the characters of the book.</p>

<p><em>A Little Life</em> is one of those books that, upon completion, you wish to have been a bit more longer - or to have never ended. A book that will forever have a special place on my bookshelf.</p>

		<h1>The Curry Coast</h1>
		<p>A travel writer’s greatest challenge is to transport his readers to the realm he is trying to describe with his words, experiencing the same bliss as he did, through his work. Binoo K John, however, had a particularly uphill challenge in convincing me with The Curry Coast, as the subject of the book is my homeland, the Malabar Coast. But when you, as a true Malabari, yearn to rediscover the charm of Calicut, the quaintness of Cannanore and the serenity of Mahe, Binoo can claim success for himself.

Five hundred years after Vasco da Gama discovered the sea-route around the Cape of Good Hope to India, the author embarks on a journey to the Malabar Coast, a land that has long been the bone of contention between various powers, colonial and otherwise. In the intervening centuries, the Malabar coast has transformed itself, reincarnating itself as a melting pot of cultures, traditions and heritage, remnants that various warriors of the past left behind in this battlefield. Binoo rightly starts off at Calicut, the gateway to Malabar, and importantly, where the Portuguese conquistador first set foot and terminates his sojourn in Goa, the last bastion of the Portuguese empire.

Delightfully written and evocative of the essence of Malabar, Binoo’s travelogue is a refreshing Sunday afternoon read.

		<h1>An Era of Darkness</h1>
		<p><p>The genesis of <em>An Era of Darkness</em> is the brilliant speech made by the author at the Oxford Union. At that time, the speech caught the imagination of many Indians, who were fed by English novelists who extolled the greatness of the British Empire, with a few of them even going as far ahead as to lay claim to some of India’s assets now as their ‘gifts’: the Indian railway network is a prime example.</p>

<p>There have been many, excluding British nationalist authors of Niall Ferguson and the like, who have staunchly defended colonialism. The proponents of this argument have often claimed that British colonialism was less evil than those of the other colonial powers (Leopold’s Belgian Congo comes to mind). Often, these arguments are made considering how the commonwealth nations and the United States are faring today in the modern era. But what about a land which was by far the most prosperous nation in the world, the contributor of a quarter of the world’s GDP, the famed home of renowned artisans, acclaimed universities and a locus of science and technology, before the arrival of the East India Company in the 1600s?</p>

<p>It is this argument that Shashi Tharoor deftly brings down in his well-researched book, <em>An Era of Darkness</em>. Though a claimed nationalist, Tharoor’s arguments are not a biased rebuttal, they are backed by verifiable facts. With every chapter, the author hits home the argument that <em>everything</em> that the British did in India was never for the Indians, but for its own benefit. The racism, the economic exploitation, the policy of <em>divide et impera</em> were all meant to subjugate a once great people to their knees, to bow down to the might and ruthlessness of the Empire, to pay for the avarice of the East India Company. Raj apologists may claim that the idea of a unified India did not exist before the British Empire; but who is to say that left to its own, India could not have been a unified, pluralist democracy?</p>

<p>However ruthless and criminal the British Empire may be, it represented a democracy with free press and a conscious international image. This was not the case with many colonial powers or dictatorships around the world and Tharoor considers this to be key to Gandhism’s success. For a dictatorship that considered that exterminating Jews was the <em>right</em> thing, Gandhism and non-violence could have offered them no solutions. In Tharoor’s own words: ‘the ultimate tribute to the British Raj might lie in the quality of the Mahatma who opposed it.’</p>

<p>A grim, dark read for anybody, regardless of your interest in colonial history.</p>

		<h1>The Lonely City</h1>
		<p><p><em>Loneliness is by no means a wholly worthless experience, but rather one that cuts right to the heart of what we value and what we need. Many marvellous things have emerged from the lonely city; things forged in loneliness, but also things that function to redeem it.</em></p>

<p>I might not consider myself lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone, in solitude. It’s one of the few things that I am absolutely comfortable with - being comfortable with my own company, travelling alone in my own thoughts. Of course, this does not mean I’m a recluse - I have terrific friends, but I’m much more of an introvert than you might think. I need my own personal space. <em>A lot of personal space.</em></p>

<p>The book is two things - Olivia Laing’s experiences with loneliness, and a deep study on loneliness in art. She makes a study of people who are alone, who share her loneliness in what is one of the most populous cities on the planet, New York City.</p>

<p>The Lonely City introduced me to a myriad of artists and photographers, some of them who I have never heard of. Andy Warhol, David Wojnarowicz, Valerie Solanas and Peter Hujar, among others. Laing explores loneliness and solitude in their work, including a brilliant analysis of Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks, on how the painting’s colours and subtle details (some of them which I have never noticed). In Hopper’s own words, <em>‘I was unconsciously painting the loneliness of a large city.’</em></p>

<p>Fascinating and poignant, this book is for all the introverts, for the people who are perfectly comfortable in their own company, for those who value their solitude more than anything else.</p>

		<h1>The Feast of the Goat</h1>
		<p><p>After reading 52 books in 2016, I thought I’d settle down for a much smaller number this year, mostly because I wanted to delve deeper into the literature I read, spend more time thinking, analyzing, losing myself in the thoughts of the author. The voracious reader in me would still not let go, as I find myself huddled in my room, blazing through book after book. A week into 2017 and I am already into my second read of the year, and boy, it has been a really memorable one.</p>

<p>I had always wanted to read Latin American fiction, with most of Gabriel García Márquez’s work on my reading list for this year. However, before I step into Márquez’s world of magical realism, I wanted to read another famed Latin American author - Mario Vargas Llosa. His 2000 book, <em>The Feast of the Goat</em>, is what I got my hands on.</p>

<p><em>The Feast of the Goat</em> is no easy novel to begin with. Llosa vividly portrays the harsh reality of tyranny through the story of the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, ‘the Goat’. The novel, in two parallel threads, follows the last days of the <em>Benevolent Father</em>, and how his tyrannical rule deprived a fourteen-year old girl, Urania Cabral, of her childhood. A masterful blend of history and fiction, the novel is vivid in it’s depiction of the Dominican Republic under Trujillo’s regime, and often left me gasping for breath, shocked at times as I read Llosa’s prose.</p>

<p>What a start to 2017 has it been!</p>
